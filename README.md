# Docker: Zero to Hero

This project is meant to learn the basics of docker. It should be enough to 
get both our Java applications and our React applications packaged in
containers so that they can be deployed to the cloud. The following topics are
covered:

* Dockerfile
* Docker images
* Docker containers
* Docker volumes
* Docker networks
* Docker compose
